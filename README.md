# Hello-World
I'm reading the GitHub guide and following its instructions

I was born in Bangladesh and this is where I've made my home. I first tried my hand at programming (BASIC) back in Grade 10. I then did a semester of C in my first year of university. I did a bit of HTML in the years that followed but nothing in the last 20 years.

Now I'm studying Data Science on Coursera and part of that Specialization is learning R. And that's why I'm on GitHub. Because I need it as part of my Data Science toolbox.
